{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:sae sim h3/elleb} Implements the simulation stage using Henderson's Method III variance decomposition or ELL's variance decomposition to obtain EB small area estimates.

{title:Options}

{synopthdr:Required}
{synoptline}

{phang}
{opt area(varname)} Option is necessary and indicates variable denoting level of area effect. The only constraint is that the variable must be numeric and should match across datasets (survey and census), although it is recommended it follows a hierarchical structure similar to the one proposed by Zhao (2006).

{phang}
{opt UNIQid(varname numeric)} option specifies the numeric variable that indicates the unique identifiers in the census and survey dataset. This is necessary to ensure replicability of the analysis, and the name should match the one of the unique identifier from the source dataset.

{phang}
{opt mcrep(integer)} Indicates the number of Montecarlo Simulations to be executed.

{phang}
{opt bsrep(integer)} Indicates the number of Bootstrap populations to be executed to obtain the MSE estimate. Note that every bootstrap population will execute the number of Montecarlo simulations indicated in mcrep().

{phang}
{opt matin(string)} The matin option indicates the path and filename of the Mata format target dataset. The dataset must created with the sae data import command; it is necessary.

{phang}
{opt INDicators(string)}  The indicators option is used to request the indicators to be estimated from the
simulated vectors of welfare. Possible indicators are: fgt0, fgt1, fgt2, ge0, ge1, ge2

{phang}
{opt aggids(numlist sort)} The aggids option indicates the different aggregation levels for which the indicators are to be obtained, values placed here tell the command how many digits to the left to move to get the indicators at that level. Using the same hierarchical id specified in the area option, AAMMEEE, if the user specifies 0, 3, 5, and 7, it would lead to aggregates at each of the levels E, M, A and the national level. Note that it is NOT advised to report results at a higher level than that of area(), it is likely that the MSE is underestimated. Users should specify 0 if they are not using a hierarchical id.

{phang}
{opt pwcensus(string)} Indicates the variable which corresponds to the expansion factors to be used in the target (census) dataset, it must always be specified. The user must have added the variable to the imported data (sae data import) i.e. the census data. 

{synopthdr:Optional}
{synoptline}

{phang}
{opt Zvar(varlist numeric fv)} The zvar option is necessary for specifying the alpha model, the user must place the independent variables of the alpha model (Heteroskedasticity) under the option.

{phang}
{opt yhat(varlist numeric fv)} The yhat option is also a part of the alpha model. Variables listed here will be interacted with the predicted y hat from the OLS model.

{phang}
{opt yhat2(varlist numeric fv)} The yhat2 option is also a part of the alpha model. Variables listed here will be interacted with the predicted y hat squared from the OLS model.

{phang}
{opt lny} option indicates that the dependent variable in the welfare model is in log form. This is relevant for the second stage of the analysis in order to get appropriate simulated values.

{phang}
{opt bcox} Option tells command to execute bcskew0 (Box-Cox transform - Zero skewness) on the dependent variable of your model.

{phang}
{opt lnskew} Option tells command to execute lnskew0 (log shift transform - Zero skewness) on the dependent variable of your model.

{phang}
{opt lnskew_w} Option tells command to execute lnskew0 (log shift transform - Zero skewness) on the dependent variable of your model. It allows for the use of survey weights in transformation.

{phang}
{opt s2s_spec} option indicates that the survey is not a subset of the census and allows for cases where an area used for the model is not present in the census.

{phang}
{opt seed(integer)} option is necessary for the second stage of the analysis and ensures replicability. Users should be aware that Stata’s default pseudo-random number generator in Stata 14 is different than that of previous versions.

{phang}
{opt plinevar(string)}  option allows users to indicate a variable in the target data set which is to be used as the threshold for the Foster Greer Thorbeck indexes (Foster, Greer, and Thorbeck 1984) to be predicted from the second stage simulations. The user must have added the variable in the sae data import command when preparing the target dataset. Only one variable may be specified.

{phang}
{opt PLINEs(numlist sort)} option allows users to explicitly indicate the threshold to be used, this option is preferred when the threshold is constant across all observations. Additionally, it is possible to specify multiple lines, separated by a space.

{phang}
{opt ydump(string)} The user must provide path and filename for a Mata format dataset to be created with the simulated dependent variables. This can then be exported to Stata, see sae data export

{phang}
{opt addvars(varlist numeric fv)} The addvars option allows users to add variables to the dataset created from the simulations. These variables must have been included into the target dataset created with the sae data import command.

{phang}
{opt method(string)} The method option allows users to specify different inverters for the GLS estimation. Options include  cholinv, cholinv_la, luinv, luinv_la. Changing the inverter can yield considerable speed gains.
